# What you liked
feedback_liked: Assignment felt relevant. 
  

# What you disliked and suggestions for improvement
feedback_disliked: Very tedious at times. Instructions were a little fragmented, missing instructions on the question body parameter for the getMovies function. Lots of variables that weren't initialized anywhere but required to do the assignment (i.e. feed, chat, in Friends.tsx). Didn't register a route for logging out in the stub files.
